# THE WATCHER PROTOCOL

> *"No loud noises. No cheap jump scares. Just the slow realization that something is fundamentally wrong."*

A psychological horror mod for Minecraft that creates genuine dread through environmental manipulation, behavioral learning, and subtle reality corruption. This is not your typical horror mod - it's designed to unsettle, not startle.

---

## 🎭 Philosophy

THE WATCHER PROTOCOL rejects conventional horror tropes:

- ❌ No loud noises
- ❌ No predictable jump scares  
- ❌ No obvious monsters stalking you every five minutes

Instead, it provides:

- ✅ **Uncertainty** - Nothing behaves quite right
- ✅ **False Safety** - Your base isn't safe anymore
- ✅ **Subtle Manipulation** - Small changes that accumulate
- ✅ **Delayed Consequences** - Your actions unlock your doom
- ✅ **Personal Horror** - The mod learns and imitates your behavior

**Fear comes from loss of trust in reality, not noise.**

## 🌟 Key Features

### Behavioral Learning System
The mod tracks everything you do:
- Mining patterns and preferred depths
- Base layouts and building styles
- Movement routes and habits
- Sleep cycles and timing
- Chest organization patterns

This data is used to create **personal, targeted horror** that feels unique to your playstyle.

### Seven Horror Phases

#### Phase 1: The Unsettling
- Crops grow irregularly
- Furnace times fluctuate randomly
- Redstone occasionally double-ticks
- Mob AI shows subtle anomalies

#### Phase 2: The Doubt
- Distant footsteps with no source
- False mining sounds underground
- Door sounds without doors moving
- Torches appear where you didn't place them

#### Phase 3: The Presence
- Shadow figures in the fog
- Impossible water reflections
- Subtle camera micro-tilts
- Breathing sounds when at full health

#### Phase 4: The Interference
- Doors open slightly at night
- Crops uproot themselves
- Tunnels form behind you
- Biomes bleed into each other

#### Phase 5: The Mockery
- Footsteps matching your exact walking pattern
- Mining sounds mimicking your rhythm
- Underground duplicates of your base (with something wrong)
- Your patterns, copied and distorted

#### Phase 6: The Confrontation
- **The Watcher manifests**
- 3 blocks tall, silently watching
- Moves at 90% normal speed
- Disappears when stared at too long
- Slowly approaches if ignored

#### Phase 7: The Unraveling
- Chunk borders become visible
- Terrain loads incorrectly
- Physics occasionally fails
- Impossible geometry appears
- Reality itself breaks down

### No Victory Condition
There is no boss to defeat. No final battle. The only way to stop it:

**Abandon the world.**

But if you regenerate the same seed... **Phase 3 begins immediately.** The world remembers.

### Surviving the Protocol

1. **Pay Attention to Details**
   - Document what seems wrong
   - Keep notes on patterns
   - Trust your instincts

2. **Don't Ignore the Signs**
   - Early warning signs matter
   - Small changes compound
   - Phases activate based on your behavior

3. **Understand the Triggers**
   - Mining unlocks progression
   - Building a base increases intensity
   - Time in-world accelerates phases
   - Death has consequences

4. **Know When to Leave**
   - Some worlds cannot be saved
   - Starting fresh may be the only option
   - But the seed remembers...

### What NOT to Do

- Don't dismiss anomalies as bugs
- Don't build elaborate redstone early
- Don't ignore the audio cues
- Don't think your base is safe
- Don't try to fight The Watcher
